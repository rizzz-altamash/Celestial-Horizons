      content: "Refractors use lenses to gather and focus light, producing sharp images but suffering from chromatic aberration. Reflectors use mirrors instead of lenses, offering more light-gathering capacity for the price but requiring regular alignment. Compound telescopes combine lenses and mirrors, balancing performance and portability. For beginners, a 4-6 inch Dobsonian reflector offers good views at an affordable price.",

      content: "Eyepieces determine magnification and field of view - start with a few different focal lengths. A red flashlight preserves night vision while allowing you to see your equipment. Star charts or astronomy apps help you navigate the night sky. A good mount is crucial for stable viewing. Consider a Barlow lens to effectively double your eyepiece collection by increasing magnification.",
